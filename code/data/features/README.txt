The features added at the 'enhanced_features.py' are suppossed to improve the 'packware' system by feature engineering, here's a short explanation on each of this features:

  1. Structural Cohesion Metrics
    - Section size ratios and virtual-to-raw mappings identify abnormal section structures
    - These metrics can detect sophisticated packers and obfuscation techniques that manipulate PE section layouts

  2. Entropy Relationship Features
    - Cross-sectional entropy variations capture statistical anomalies
    - Help identify encrypted/compressed sections and detect polymorphic malware that uses selective encryption

  3. API Behavioral Patterns
    - Categorical API ratios provide behavioral fingerprinting
    - Network/File/Registry/Process API distributions help identify malware capabilities without needing dynamic analysis
    - Import-to-export ratios detect library injection patterns

  4. Resource Utilization Profiles
    - Resource density and complexity metrics identify resource-based attacks
    - Resource size variance can detect steganography and resource-based payload hiding

  5. Complexity Synthesis
    - Combined complexity scoring integrates multiple dimensions of file characteristics
    - Helps detect sophisticated threats that maintain "normal" appearances in individual metrics but show anomalies in combined analysis

These features enhance detection by focusing on relationships between existing metrics rather than raw values, making the system more resistant to evasion techniques and better at identifying complex malware behaviors.
