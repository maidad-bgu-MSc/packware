Before everything, we need to mention again that you are able to produce our experiments without any need of sample files. For that, you need to download and use the pickle dataframes containing the features and labels.

Anyway, we understand that some researchers might need to look at the binaries.
Since all the executables in the wild are already on VirusTotal, you can use SHA1s of executables (provided in the pickle dataframes) to download samples from VirusTotal or any other source. We are able to share them with you as well.

## Conditions Needed To Access Samples
We are happy to release our dataset to the community. However, to avoid this dataset being misused, please read and agree to the following conditions before sending us emails.

* Do not share this data with any other researcher (except your co-authors for the project). We are happy to share with other researchers based upon their requests.
* Explain in a few sentences what you have plan to do with these samples. It shouldn't be a precise plan, as in most cases, projects evolve, and we also understand you might not feel comfortable sharing your exact idea and steps before publishing your work.
* If you are in academia, contact us using your institution email and provide us a webpage registered at the university domain that contains your name and affiliation.
* If you are in research (industrial) labs, send us an email from your company's email account and introduce yourself and company. In the email, please attach a justification letter (in PDF format) in official letterhead. The letter needs to state clearly the reasons why this dataset is being requested.

Please note that, any email not following these conditions might be ignored. Also note that, we keep the (public) list of organizations accessing these samples here.
